PRODUCT_DETAILS</strong><br /> COLUMNS:<br /> PRODUCT_ID    VARCHAR<br /> PRODUCT_NAME   VARCHAR<br /> AVAILABLE_QUANT NUMERIC<br /> </p> <strong>2. PURCHASE_ORDER</strong><br /> COLUMNS:<br /> CUSTOMER_ID    VARCHAR<br /> PRODUCT_ID   VARCHAR<br /> ORDER_QUANT   NUMERIC<br /> <p> <strong>3. ORDER_DEFICIT</strong><br /> COLUMNS:<br /> CUSTOMER_ID   VARCHAR<br /> PRODUCT_NAME  VARCHAR<br /> QUANT_DEFICIT NUMERIC<br /> </p><p> <strong>To create an Data Integrator Application for extract (from source table(s)), transform the data and load the data (into target table(s)), you have to create the following.</strong><br /> </p><p>&nbsp;</p><ul> 	<li>An Data Integrator project (called DataIntegratorApp) 	</li><li>A Data Integrator collaboration, firstETL.etl, under the project DataIntegratorApp. 	</li><li>A Composite Application project, DeploymentCompApp, to deploy the Data Integrator Application into the application server. 	</li><li>Finally, you can use the Composite Application test framework to invoke the deployed Data Integrator Service and see the response. </li></ul> <br />  [<strong>Note: </strong>This tutorial also assumes that the above said tables are pre-created.]  <br /> <p> <strong>To Add a Database connection</strong> <br /> Go to Runtime Tab. Expand the Databases Node, right click on the Drivers node and choose &quot;New Driver...&quot;. Then point to the driver location. Then create a new connection using the uploaded driver by providing the JDBC Url, user name and password.  <br /> <strong>To Create new table</strong> Right click on the JDBC Connection available under the Databases node and choose Connect. Enter user name and password. Expand the connection node. Right Click on the Tables node and Click Create Table.
